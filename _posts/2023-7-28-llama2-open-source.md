Whether Meta's new Large Language Model (LLM) called [Llama 2](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799025/meta-ai-llama-2-open-source-microsoft) is open source or not has been a debate since it was released on 18 July 2023.
Now Stefano Maffulli, the executive director for the Open Source Initiative, has commented on it:

> â€˜Open Sourceâ€™ means software under a license with specific characteristics, defined by the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/) (OSD).
> Among other requirements, for a license to be Open Source, it may not discriminate against persons or groups or fields of endeavor (OSD points 5 and 6).
> Metaâ€™s license for the LLaMa models and code does not meet this standard; specifically, it puts restrictions on commercial use for
> some users (paragraph 2) and also restricts the use of the model and software for certain purposes (the Acceptable Use Policy).
